## Assignments of M.Tech CS' Neural Networks course at ISI Kolkata

#### Assignment 1: Implement Rosenblatt's Perceptron Model
* Generate data of two linearly separable classes using Normal distribution
    - Once for two features
    - Once for three features
* Train the perceptron model on both the data
* Print the decision boundary for both
